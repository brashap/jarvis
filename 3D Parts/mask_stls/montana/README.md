# Montana Mask V2

This is the official "V2" Montana Mask design, based on the original design with design enhancements by J.Scott and Dan Robles. They feature size letters on the mask interior, larger eyelets to make threading elastic easier, and a filter that offers interior relief for the user's lips.

Notes on printing: The filter should be printed with the flange facing up. There is enough contouring on the filter to allow the flange to print without supports. All the files are the same size, they merely have different letters. The recommended amount to resize the body and filter before printing are:


- XL: 110%
- L: 100%
- ML: 95%
- M: 90%
